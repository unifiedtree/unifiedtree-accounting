  'Why is my cash balance dropping?':
    `**Cash Balance Analysis**\n\nYour cash has dropped ₹8.2L in the last 30 days. Key outflows:\n\n• ₹3.1L — Vendor payments (Reliance, AWS)\n• ₹2.4L — Advance payroll disbursement\n• ₹1.8L — Tax payments (GST Q3)\n\nRevenue collection is lagging. **Infosys BPO owes ₹28.5L** — chasing this alone would stabilise your balance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Follow up with top 3 debtors this week and defer non-critical vendor payments by 7 days.`,

  'Who are my top debtors right now?':
    `**Top Outstanding Debtors (Dec 2024)**\n\n1. Infosys BPO Ltd — **₹28.5L** (45 days overdue)\n2. Tech Mahindra — **₹19.2L** (due in 8 days)\n3. Wipro Digital — **₹15.4L** (due in 12 days)\n4. HCL Services — **₹9.8L** (14 days overdue)\n5. Tata Consultancy — **₹6.2L** (due today)\n\n**Total: ₹79.1L outstanding.** I recommend prioritising Infosys and HCL as they are overdue.`,

  'Which invoices are likely to be paid late?':
    `**Late Payment Predictions**\n\nBased on historical payment behaviour:\n\n🔴 **High risk (>70% likely late)**\n• INV-2024-0842 — Infosys BPO — ₹8.5L (already 8 days late)\n• INV-2024-0844 — HCL Services — ₹3.2L (due tomorrow)\n\n🟡 **Medium risk (40-70%)**\n• INV-2024-0850 — New customer — ₹1.8L\n\n🟢 **Low risk — likely on time**\n• All other open invoices\n\nI can draft reminder emails for high-risk customers. Would you like me to?`,

  'What GST do I need to file this month?':
    `**GST Filing Summary — January 2025**\n\n**GSTR-1** (Sales return)\n• Due: 11 Jan 2025 (12 days away)\n• B2B invoices: 18 (4 not yet uploaded)\n• B2C sales: ₹4.2L\n\n**GSTR-3B** (Monthly return)\n• Due: 20 Jan 2025\n• Net GST liability: ~₹8.9L\n• ITC available: ₹2.1L\n• **Cash to pay: ₹6.8L**\n\n**Action items:**\n1. Upload 4 pending B2B invoices to GSTR-1\n2. Match GSTR-2B ITC before 3B filing\n3. Arrange ₹6.8L in Electronic Cash Ledger`,

  'Summarise P&L in plain English':
    `**Profit & Loss — Apr–Dec 2024 (Plain English)**\n\nYour business earned **₹9.4Cr in revenue** this year so far — up 22% from last year. The biggest earners were IT services (68%) and consulting (21%).\n\nYou spent **₹8.85Cr** running the business — salaries are the biggest cost (₹4.2Cr), followed by AWS/cloud infra (₹1.1Cr) and office expenses (₹65L).\n\n**Net profit: ₹54.2L** — a 22.4% margin, which is above industry average.\n\n⚠️ Watch out: Travel and entertainment spend is up 43% vs budget. That needs attention in Q4.`,

  `I've reviewed the relevant transactions and records. Here's what stands out:\n\nYour numbers are largely on track, though I spotted a few anomalies that may need your review. I can drill into any specific area — just ask.`,
  `**Quick Analysis**\n\nLooking at your recent activity, the trends suggest you're performing well compared to last period. However, there are some items worth actioning before month-end.\n\nWould you like me to prioritise what needs immediate attention vs what can wait?`,
